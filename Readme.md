# VtlSoftware Logging Aspects

A collection of Aspects created with Metalama that will allow you to quickly add logging to any project in your solutions.

The solution comprises three projects, one is the main Logging projects itself, the other a set of tests for all of the Aspects and a console project to check some eligibility scenarios.

The VtlSoftware.Logging project is the source code for the VtlSoftware.Logging Nuget Package which can be found on Nuget.Org
